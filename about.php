		Remember the time when you broke up and finished a whole bucket of ice-cream? 
		And when you had a bite of that city's best biryani but said, "My mom cooks better than this!" and cried because you missed her?
		And the times when a reunion was planned at a Pizza shop and all the memories came live just there with every bite?<br/>
		Well, food always brings memories, fun, happiness and lots of LOVE with it.
		When no one is there or even when everyone is there, food is one thing which creates that bond of love.
		So, this is the place, where food decides to love you back with all it has got!<br/>
		Enjoy the amazing taste of these food items and the warmth of its love:)
