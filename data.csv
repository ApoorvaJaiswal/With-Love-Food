"Easy Gluten Free Oat Waffles",./recipes/r1.jpg,"These light, crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside, gluten-free waffles are my favorite waffles! They’re heart healthy, too. This waffle recipe requires just one flour, oat flour, which you can easily make yourself (see note). Recipe yields 3 to 4 round, 7-inch Belgian waffles, or 6 small, square Belgian waffles (the size shown here).
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS<br/>

1 ½ cups (128 grams) oat flour*, certified gluten-free if necessary<br/>
2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>
½ teaspoon salt<br/>
Pinch of cinnamon, optional<br/>
¾ cup room temperature milk of choice (light coconut milk, nut milk, cow’s milk)<br/>
¼ cup + 1 tablespoon melted coconut oil or 5 tablespoons butter, melted<br/>
2 large eggs<br/>
2 tablespoons maple syrup<br/>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/><br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: oat flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. In another bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: milk, melted coconut oil or butter, eggs, maple syrup and vanilla extract. (If your coconut oil solidifies on contact with cold ingredients, gently heat the wet mixture in the microwave in ten seconds intervals, until it melts again.)<br/>
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir with a big spoon until just combined (the batter will still be a little lumpy). Let the batter rest for 10 minutes so the oat flour has time to soak up some of the moisture. Plug in your waffle iron to preheat now (if your waffle iron has a temperature/browning dial, set it to medium-high).<br/>
Once 10 minutes is up, give the batter one more swirl with your spoon. Pour batter onto the heated waffle iron, enough to cover the center and most of the central surface area, and close the lid. Once the waffle is deeply golden and crisp, transfer it to a cooling rack or baking sheet. Don’t stack your waffles on top of each other, or they’ll lose crispness. If desired, keep your waffles warm by placing them in a 200 degree oven until you’re ready to serve.
Repeat with remaining batter. Serve waffles with maple syrup and nut butter, or any other toppings that sound good!"
"Healthy Pumpkin Muffins",./recipes/r2.jpg,"Easy, one bowl, maple-sweetened, pumpkin muffins made with whole wheat flour, oats, coconut oil and spices! These healthy muffins are as light, fluffy and delicious as their coffee shop counterparts. Recipe yields 12 muffins.<br/><br/>

INGREDIENTS<br/>

1 cup melted coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil*<br/>
½ cup maple syrup or honey<br/>
2 eggs, at room temperature<br/>
1 cup pumpkin purée<br/>
¼ cup milk of choice (I used almond milk)<br/>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br/>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>
½ teaspoon salt<br/>
½ teaspoon cinnamon, plus more for sprinkling on top<br/>
½ teaspoon ground ginger<br/>
¼ teaspoon nutmeg<br/>
¼ teaspoon allspice or cloves<br/>
1 ¾ cups white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour<br/>
3 cup old-fashioned oats, plus more for sprinkling on top<br/>
<br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). If necessary, grease all 12 cups of your muffin tin with butter or non-stick cooking spray (my pan is non-stick and didn’t require any grease).<br/>
2.In a large bowl, beat the oil and maple syrup or honey together with a whisk. Add the eggs, and beat well. Mix in the pumpkin purée and milk, followed by the baking soda, vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice.<br/>
3.Add the flour and oats to the bowl and mix with a large spoon, just until combined. If you’d like to add any additional mix-ins**, like nuts, chocolate or dried fruit, fold them in now.<br/>
4.Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups. For these muffins, it’s ok to fill the cups a little higher than you normally would. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a small amount of oats, followed by a sprinkle of cinnamon. Bake muffins for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.<br/>
5.Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. These muffins are delicate until they cool down (you have been warned!). You might need to run a butter knife along the outer edge of the muffins to loosen them from the pan.
These muffins will keep at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. They keep well in the freezer in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months (just defrost individual muffins as needed)."
"Simple Goat Cheese and Egg Toasts with Peas and Dill",./recipes/r3.jpg,"Goat cheese slathered on whole grain toast, topped with an egg (fried or scrambled) and a sprinkling of fresh peas and herbs. An easy breakfast or any-time-of-day meal.<br/><br/>

INGREDIENTS<br/>

Per toast<br/>

1 slice hearty whole grain bread<br/>
1 ½ ounces goat cheese, softened<br/>
1 egg, fried, or 2 eggs, scrambled<br/>

Freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br/><br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.Bring a small pot of water to boil for the peas. Toast your bread. Spread a generous amount of goat cheese on top (if your goat cheese isn’t spreading easily, transfer it to a heat-safe bowl and microwave for 10 seconds).<br/>
2.Once the water is boiling, drop in the peas and cook until crisp-tender, about 90 seconds. Drain the peas and return them to the pot.<br/>
3.If you’re planning to fry your egg, sprinkle your cooked peas onto the goat cheese and gently press down on the peas so they stick.<br/>
4.Prepare your egg(s) as desired. If you’re scrambling the eggs, season the eggs with salt and pepper before cooking, and toss in a handful of peas before the eggs set.<br/>
5.Transfer the cooked egg(s) on top of your goat cheese-covered toast. Top with a slight sprinkle of chopped fresh herbs, salt and pepper."

6.Serve in bowls, with chopped cilantro and a lime wedge on top. If desired, serve rice or naan on the side. Leftovers keep well, refrigerated, for up to 5 days."
"Ultimate Gazpacho",./recipes/r5.jpg,"This gazpacho recipe is the best! It’s a refreshing chilled summer soup, perfect for your garden tomatoes and cucumber. Be sure to make it in advance so the soup can chill for at least 2 hours. Recipe yields 5 cups, enough for 4 servings.<br/><br/>

INGREDIENTS<br/>

2 ½ pounds ripe red tomatoes (about 4 large or 9 small)<br/>
1 small Vidalia onion (½ pound), peeled and cut into rough 1 chunks<br/>
1 small cucumber (½ pound), peeled and seeded<br/>
1 medium red bell pepper, cored and seeded<br/>
¼ cup fresh basil leaves, plus extra for garnish<br/>
1 large garlic clove, peeled<br/>
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil<br/>
2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar<br/>
¾ teaspoon fine sea salt<br/>
Freshly ground black pepper<br/>
<br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.To prepare your veggies, place your blender bowl, a medium serving bowl, and a small bowl on the counter. Core the tomatoes and cut them into rough 1 chunks. Reserve about ¼ cup of the juicy tomato seeds and place them in your small bowl (we’ll use them as a garnish later). Add half of the tomato chunks to the blender, and the other half to your serving bowl. Add all of the onion chunks to the blender.<br/>
2.Cut off about one-fourth of the cucumber. Finely chop that piece and place it in the small bowl. Slice the rest of the cucumber into rough 1? chunks, and divide them between the blender and the serving bowl. Cut off about one-fourth of the bell pepper, finely chop that piece, and add it to the small bowl. Slice the rest of the bell pepper into rough 1? chunks and divide them between the blender and the serving bowl.<br/>
3.To the blender, add the basil, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, salt and about 10 twists of black pepper. Securely fasten the lid and blend, starting on low and increasing to high speed, until the mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes.<br/>
4.Pour the contents of the serving bowl (the remaining chunks of tomato, cucumber and bell pepper) into the blender. Fasten the lid and blend for just 10 to 20 seconds, until the ingredients are broken up into small pieces. Stop there, or blend a little longer if you prefer smaller pieces.
Add a small pinch of salt to the small bowl of garnishes, stir, and store it in the fridge. Chill the soup for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.<br/>
5.Before serving, taste, and add additional salt (I sometimes add another ¼ teaspoon) and/or black pepper if necessary. To serve, divide the soup into small bowls or cups, and top with the reserved cucumber and bell pepper. Top with a few tiny or torn basil leaves and a light sprinkle of pepper. Leftover servings keep well, covered and refrigerated, for 3 to 4 days."
"10-Minute Quesadillas",./recipes/r6.jpg,"Quesadillas are the perfect quick meal. Enjoy this vegetarian quesadilla recipe in under 10 minutes! Recipe yields 1 quesadilla (3 slices), so multiply as necessary.<br/><br/>

INGREDIENTS<br/>

Per quesadilla<br/>

1 whole-grain flour tortilla (about 8? diameter)<br/>
½ cup freshly grated cheddar cheese<br/>
¼ cup cooked black beans or pinto beans, rinsed and drained<br/>
1 tablespoon chopped red bell pepper or jarred roasted bell pepper or a few thinly sliced cherry tomatoes<br/>
1 tablespoon chopped red onion or green onion<br/>
1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapeño (if you like heat)<br/>
1 teaspoon avocado oil, melted butter or extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing<br/>
Any of the following, for serving: Salsa, guacamole or strips of avocado, sour cream, hot sauce, chopped fresh cilantro.<br/>
<br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Warm your tortilla for about 30 seconds, flipping halfway. Flip once more, then sprinkle one-half of the tortilla with about half of the cheese. Cover the cheese evenly with the remaining fillings: beans, bell pepper, onion and jalapeño (if using).<br/>
2.Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the fillings, and fold over the empty side of the tortilla to enclose the fillings. Quickly brush the top of the quesadilla with a light coating of oil, then carefully flip it with a spatula.v
Let the quesadilla cook until golden and crispy on the bottom, about 1 to 2 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent burning the tortilla. Brush the top with a light coating of oil, then flip it and cook until the second side is golden and crispy.<br/>
3.Immediately remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board. Let it cool for a minute to give the cheese time to set, then use a chef’s knife to slice it into 3 pieces. Serve promptly, with any sauces or garnishes that you’d like."
"Vegan Mac and Cheese",./recipes/r7.jpg,"This vegan mac and cheese recipe is incredibly creamy and remarkably cheese-like! You won’t believe how delicious dairy-free mac and cheese can be. Recipe yields 2 large or 4 modest servings.
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS<br/>

8 ounces whole-grain macaroni elbows<br/>
1 head of broccoli, florets cut into small bites (about 1 ½ to 2 cups), optional*<br/>
1 ½ tablespoons avocado oil or extra-virgin olive oil<br/>
1 small yellow onion, chopped (about 1 ½ cups)<br/>
1 cup peeled and grated russet potato (4 ounces, about 1 small or ½ medium potato), preferably organic<br/>
3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced<br/>
½ teaspoon garlic powder<br/>
½ teaspoon onion powder<br/>
½ teaspoon dry mustard powder<br/>
½ teaspoon fine sea salt, more to taste<br/>
Small pinch of Frontier Co-Op red pepper flakes<br/>
? cup raw cashews**<br/>
1 cup water, more as necessary<br/>
¼ cup Frontier Co-Op nutritional yeast<br/> 
2 to 3 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar, to taste<br/><br/>

INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta. Cook according to package directions. If using broccoli, stir it into the pot when just 2 to 3 more minutes remain. Drain, and transfer the contents to a large serving bowl.<br/>
2.Meanwhile, in a medium-to-large saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and turning translucent, about 5 minutes.<br/>
3.Add the grated potato, garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, salt and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine, and cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute to enhance their flavors.<br/>
4.Add the cashews and water, and stir to combine. Let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue simmering, stirring frequently and reducing heat as necessary to avoid a rapid boil, until the potatoes are completely tender and cooked through, about 5 to 8 minutes.
Carefully pour the mixture into a blender. Add the nutritional yeast and 2 teaspoons vinegar. Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides if necessary. If the mixture won’t blend easily or if you would prefer a thinner consistency, add water in ¼ cup increments, blending after each one.
Taste, and blend in additional salt until the sauce is utterly irresistible (I typically add at least another ½ teaspoon). If it needs a little more zip, add the remaining teaspoon of vinegar. Blend again.<br/>
5.Pour the sauce into the bowl of pasta. Stir until well combined, and serve immediately. Leftovers keep well, chilled and covered, for 3 to 4 days. Gentle reheat, adding a tiny splash of water if necessary to loosen up the sauce."
"Coffee Chocolate Chip Blondies",./recipes/r8.jpg,"Crazy delicious chocolate chip blondies recipe with toasted pecans. Made with coconut sugar and whole wheat flour, so they’re healthier than most, too! Recipe yields 12 large or up to 24 small blondies, depending on how you slice them.<br/><br/>

INGREDIENTS<br/>

1 ½ cups white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour (Sarah used all-purpose)<br/>
1 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br/>
12 tablespoons (1 ½ sticks) unsalted butter<br/>
2 cups packed coconut sugar, or 1 ½ cups packed brown sugar<br/>
¾ teaspoon salt<br/>
2 tablespoons strong coffee, room temperature<br/>
1 egg<br/>
1 ½ tablespoons vanilla extract (yes, tablespoons)<br/>
¾ cup chopped pecans<br/>
¾ cup bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips<br/>
<br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.With the oven rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and line it with parchment paper.<br/>
2.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, coconut sugar and salt. Cook, stirring often, until the butter is completely melted and the mixture is hot but not simmering. Remove from the heat and stir in the coffee until well combined (if the mixture refuses to come together, let it cool for a minute or two and try again). Let the mixture cool to room temperature, about 15 to 20 minutes.<br/>
3.In the meantime, pour the pecans onto a small rimmed baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until they’re nice and fragrant, stirring halfway. Set aside to cool.
Once the butter and sugar mixture has cooled to room temperature, add the egg and vanilla and whisk until combined. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the flour mixture and stir just until combined. Add the pecans and chocolate chips and stir gently to combine.<br/>
4.Using a spatula, spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan (this is a little tricky with the parchment paper, but you can do it, I promise). Bake for 18 to 24 minutes, until the blondies are set on the edges and the top is golden brown and just beginning to form cracks. A wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into the blondies should come out with just a couple of crumbs.<br/>
5.Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let it cool completely. Grab opposite corners of the parchment paper and gently lift the blondies from the pan onto a flat surface. Cut them into squares (big or small, up to you) and serve."
"Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart",./recipes/r9.jpg,"This chocolate peanut butter tart recipe is creamy and delicious! It’s also vegan, gluten free, and naturally sweetened, believe it or not! While this recipe is pretty easy to make, it requires some cooling/chilling time. Be sure to place cans of regular coconut milk in your refrigerator at least 12 hours in advance (I usually keep a few in my fridge at all times). Recipe yields one 9? tart (about 8 to 10 slices).<br/><br/>

INGREDIENTS<br/>

Oat and almond crust<br/><br/>

2 cups old-fashioned oats (certified gluten-free if necessary)<br/>
½ cup raw almonds<br/>
½ teaspoon salt<br/>
Pinch of ground cinnamon<br/>
1 cup melted coconut oil<br/>
3 to 4 tablespoons maple syrup or honey, as needed<br/>
Chocolate layer<br/><br/>

1 ¼ cups bittersweet chocolate chips (about 60% cacao content is perfect)<br/>
1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk, chilled at least 12 hours<br/>
¼ cup maple syrup or honey, to taste<br/>
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>
Dash of salt<br/>
Whipped coconut cream layer<br/><br/>

1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk, chilled at least 12 hours<br/>
½ cup peanut butter<br/>
2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey<br/>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>
Optional garnishes<br/><br/>

Light dusting of cocoa powder (sprinkle it over the top in a sifter or fine mesh sieve)<br/>
Sprinkles (I used these naturally colored sprinkles)<br/><br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.To make the crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and lightly oil a 9? tart pan, preferably one with a removable base, with melted coconut oil.
In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the S blade, combine the oats, almonds, salt, and cinnamon. Process the mixture until the pieces resemble coarse sand. Pour the coconut oil and 3 tablespoons sweetener into the mixture and process until it forms a malleable dough. Add up to 1 tablespoon more sweetener if the dough needs a bit more moisture to come together.<br/>
2.Scoop the dough into your prepared tart pan and fold in any almond or oat crumbs that haven’t already incorporated into the dough. Press the dough into the tart pan evenly, using the heel of your hand to press the bottom smooth, which will help push the crust up the sides. 3.Aim for even thickness across the bottom and up the edges (I didn’t go quite far enough up the edges in my photos). Prick the base of the crust all over with a fork. (If the dough isn’t cooperating, set the crust in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to firm it up before baking.)<br/>
4.Bake the unfilled tart crust for 12 to 14 minutes, until it’s firm to the touch and turning lightly golden at the edges. Place it on a cooling rack until cooled, about 30 minutes.<br/>
5.Meanwhile, to make the chocolate layer: <br/><br/>Gently melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring after every 30 second interval. Let the chocolate cool for 15 to 20 minutes, so that it’s still warm enough to mix with the coconut cream, but not so warm that it melts the cream.<br/>
6.To make the peanut butter whipped cream topping: Open one chilled can of coconut milk. You should see a thick, white layer of condensed coconut cream on top (if not, save the contents of this can for another use and open another can). Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a medium mixing bowl, leaving the more clear coconut “water” behind (you can save the coconut water for smoothies or discard it). Add the peanut butter, sweetener and vanilla extract. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and light, with soft peaks.<br/>
7.To finish the chocolate layer: Once the chocolate has cooled, open another chilled can of coconut milk. Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a clean, medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the semi-cooled chocolate, sweetener, vanilla and salt. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and somewhat fluffy. Taste and add additional sweetener if desired, keeping in mind that once chilled, it will taste slightly less sweet.<br/>
8.Scoop the chocolate mixture into the baked tart crust. Use a rubber or silicone spatula to evenly distribute the filling and smooth the top. Rinse off and dry your spatula, then use it to spread the whipped cream layer on top, leaving an inch bare around the edges so the chocolate layer remains visible. <br/>Chill the tart for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours or longer, so the coconut whipped cream has time to set.
Before serving, sprinkle with cocoa powder and/or sprinkle, if desired. If your tart pan has a removable bottom, carefully remove the tart so it’s easier to slice through the edges. Slice the tart into even wedges using a sharp chef’s knife, wiping off the blade after every slice. Serve immediately. This tart keeps well, chilled and covered, for up to 5 days."
"Blueberry Almond Crisp",./recipes/r10.jpg,"This amazing blueberry crisp recipe is the perfect summertime dessert! It’s easy to make with blueberries, maple syrup, lemon, oats and almonds. It’s gluten free, too! Recipe yields 6 to 8 servings (a lot!).<br/><br/>

"Healthier Strawberry Shortcake",./recipes/r12.jpg,"Classic strawberry shortcake made healthier—this recipe is made with honey or maple syrup, whole grains and coconut milk. So delicious! It’s vegan if you use maple syrup instead of honey. Recipe yields 9 servings (so quite a bit—if you’re serving just 4 people, I’d probably prepare just 1 pound of strawberries, and enjoy leftover shortcakes as though they are sweet biscuits).<br/><br/>

INGREDIENTS
<br/>
Shortcake
<br/>
2 ½ cups white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour<br/>
2 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br/>
½ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt<br/>
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>
1 ¼ cups regular (full fat) coconut milk (from a well-shaken can at room temperature*), plus more for brushing on top<br/>
¼ cup honey or maple syrup<br/>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar (optional), for sprinkling on top<br/>
Coconut whipped cream – can be replaced with 2 cups regular whipped cream, if you prefer<br/>

1 can (14 ounces) regular (full fat) coconut milk or coconut cream, chilled for at least 12 hours<br/>
1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup<br/>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>
Strawberries<br/>

2 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced lengthwise, divided (reserve a few small, whole strawberries for garnishing, if you’d like)<br/>
1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup
<br/><br/>
INSTRUCTIONS
<br/>
1.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside. Place a medium-sized glass or metal mixing bowl in the freezer to chill for the whipped cream.<br/>
2.To prepare the shortcake: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stir to combine.<br/>
3.In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup or smaller mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk, honey and vanilla. Whisk to blend, then pour the wet mixture in to the dry.<br/>
4.Mix with a big spoon until you have a cohesive dough. If the dough is sticky and unmanageable, let it rest for a few minutes—if it’s still being difficult, add another tablespoon of flour and stir just until incorporated.<br/>
5.Lightly flour your work surface, and turn the dough over onto it. Knead the dough a few times, just enough to bring the dough together. Then, press the dough into a square shape about 1 deep.<br/>
6.Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice the dough into 3 even columns and 3 even rows, to make 9 squares. Place the squares onto your prepared baking sheet, leaving a couple inches around each one. Brush the tops of the dough liberally with coconut milk, and sprinkle them with turbinado sugar, if using. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, until they are firm to the touch.<br/>
7.Meanwhile, prepare the coconut whipped cream: Open the can of chilled coconut milk or coconut cream, and scoop the solid white portion into your chilled bowl, leaving the watery part behind. With an electric hand mixer, beat until smooth and relatively fluffy. Add the honey and vanilla extract and blend to combine. Refrigerate until you’re ready to serve.<br/>
8.To prepare the strawberries: Place half of the sliced strawberries in a medium mixing bowl and mash them with a potato masher (or pastry cutter or big fork) until juicy. Add the remaining sliced strawberries and honey and stir to combine. Set aside until ready to serve.<br/>
8.When you’re ready to serve, carefully slice the shortcakes in half lengthwise with a paring knife. Top the lower halve of each shortcake liberally with sliced strawberries, followed by whipped cream. Top with the upper halve of the shortcake. If you want to make them extra decadent, add one more dollop of whipped cream and maybe a small strawberry on top. Serve immediately."

? cup capers
1 tablespoon Kalamata olive brine (from your jar of olives)
1 tablespoon caper brine (from your jar of capers)
3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon olive oil
½ cup chopped fresh parsley leaves, divided
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt, if necessary
Everything else

8 ounces whole grain spaghetti, or an equivalent combination of spaghetti and zucchini noodles (I used 6 ounces spaghetti and one 8-ounce zucchini, spiralized)

INSTRUCTIONS

In a medium saucepan, combine the tomato sauce, olives, capers, olive bring, caper brine, garlic and red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes.
Remove the sauce from heat, and stir in the olive oil and almost all of the chopped parsley, reserving some to sprinkle on the finished bowls. Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper and salt, if necessary (the sauce was already plenty salty for me, so I didn’t add any salt).
While the sauce cooks, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook your spaghetti according to package directions. Drain and return it to the pot.
If you’re adding zucchini noodles, spiralize the zucchini with a spiralizer (here’s how), or turn the zucchini into noodles with a julienne peeler, or grate the zucchini the long way on a large box grater.
Once all of your components are ready, pour the sauce over the pasta and stir to combine. Stir in the zucchini noodles, if using (if you plan on having leftovers, store extra zucchini noodles separately, as they leech water once they come into contact with salty ingredients). Divide into individual bowls and top each bowl with a light sprinkle of parsley. Serve immediately."
"Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Pasta with Roasted Vegetables",./recipes/r14.jpg,"Homemade sun-dried tomato pesto with pasta and roasted vegetables is an easy weeknight dinner! Easily made gluten free and/or vegan (see notes). Recipe yields 4 to 6 main servings.
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS<br/>

Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto
<br/>
One 6.7-ounce jar DeLallo sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil*<br/>
1 cup packed fresh basil leaves, plus extra for garnishing<br/>
¼ cup slivered almonds<br/>
3 to 4 cloves garlic, to taste<br/>
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br/>
¼ to ½ teaspoon salt, to taste<br/>
Pinch red pepper flakes<br/>
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil<br/>
Totally optional: ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan or nutritional yeast, to taste
Pasta and roasted vegetables<br/>

8 ounces whole grain pasta (I used DeLallo’s organic whole wheat gemelli, but rotini or penne would work well, too)<br/>
1 medium zucchini, diced<br/>
1 medium yellow squash, diced<br/>
1 medium red bell pepper (or orange or yellow), diced<br/>
1 medium yellow or white onion, diced<br/>
2 tablespoons olive oil<br/>
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar<br/>
Salt<br/>
Freshly ground black pepper<br/><br/>

INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.To roast the vegetables: Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Whisk together the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. On a half-sheet pan or other large, rimmed baking sheet, combine the diced zucchini, yellow squash, bell pepper and onion. Drizzle the olive oil mixture over the vegetables, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss with your hands until the vegetables are evenly coated. Arrange the vegetables in a single layer. Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until they are cooked through and golden.<br/>
2.To cook the pasta: Bring a large post of salted water to boil. Cook pasta until al dente, according to package directions. Before draining, reserve about 1 cup pasta cooking water.<br/> Transfer the cooked pasta to a large serving bowl.<br/>
3.To make the pesto: First, toast the almonds in a small skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 4 minutes. In the bowl of your food processor (a blender might work, too), combine the sun-dried tomatoes and their oil, the basil, toasted almonds, garlic, lemon juice, ¼ teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes.<br/>
4.Blend, scraping down the sides as necessary, until the contents are mixed together and roughly uniform. Drizzle in the olive oil while running the machine and blend until you’ve reached a relatively smooth, pesto-like consistency. If you’d like to add Parmesan, stir it into the pesto now. Taste and stir in additional salt and pepper, if necessary. The pesto will be thick, but we’ll thin it out with cooking water soon.<br/>
5.Pour the pesto into the warm pasta and drizzle in ¼ cup reserved cooking water. Toss to combine, adding more splashes of cooking water to thin as necessary. Toss in the roasted vegetables. Sprinkle with some chopped fresh basil and serve."
"Greek Pizza",./recipes/r15.jpg,"Homemade Greek pizza featuring feta, roasted red peppers, artichokes, olive and basil! This is a delicious weeknight meal made with pantry ingredients. Feel free to toss on some chopped red onion (¼ cup or so) if that sounds good to you. Recipe yields two 11-inch pizzas.
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS
<br/>
1 batch easy whole wheat pizza dough or 1 pound store-bought pizza dough<br/>
1 cup marinara sauce or one 32-ounce can whole tomatoes, drained and crushed by hand<br/>
½ teaspoon dried oregano<br/>
2 cups shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese<br/>

15 pitted Kalamata olives, halved lengthwise<br/>
½ cup (2 to 3 ounces) crumbled feta<br/>
Optional garnishes: three to four fresh basil leaves, torn into little pieces, and red pepper flakes<br/><br/>

INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.Preheat oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it in the oven on the top rack. Prepare dough through step 5.<br/>
2.Spread marinara sauce evenly over the pizzas, or top with drained, crushed tomatoes (crush the tomatoes over the sink to get out as much liquid as possible). Sprinkle lightly with dried oregano.<br/>
3.Divide toppings evenly over the two pizzas, beginning with shredded mozzarella, followed by roasted red pepper, artichoke, olives and lastly, the feta.<br/>
4.Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is golden and bubbly, about 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it). Transfer pizza to a cutting board and sprinkle with torn fresh basil. I sprinkled mine with red pepper flakes, too. Slice and serve!"
"Green Goddess Hummus Sandwich",./recipes/r16.jpg,"This healthy hummus sandwich recipe features crisp cucumbers, tangy quick-pickled red onions and carrots, lettuce and herbed hummus! I’m partial to the homemade hummus and pickle combination below, but feel free to substitute your favorite store-bought hummus and pickles for a quick and easy lunch.
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS<br/>

Per sandwich
<br/>
2 slices sturdy whole grain bread, lightly toasted<br/>
¼ cup homemade green goddess hummus or store-bought hummus<br/>
About a 1-inch section of cucumber, sliced thin<br/>
1 to 2 lettuce leaves, cut to size<br/>
Pickles, to taste (slice larger store-bought pickles into thin strips if necessary)<br/>
Quick-pickled red onions and carrots*
<br/>
5 to 7 medium to large carrots (¾th to 1 pound carrots)<br/>
1 small to medium red onion (about ½ pound)<br/>
1 cup plain white vinegar or white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar<br/>
1 cup water<br/>
¼ cup honey or maple syrup or sugar of choice<br/>
2 ½ teaspoons salt<br/>
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
<br/><br/>
INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.To make the quick-pickled vegetables, first peel the carrots and then use a julienne peeler or regular vegetable peeler to slice the carrot into ribbons. Use a mandoline or a sharp chefs knife to carefully slice the onion into very thin rounds. Stuff the carrots into one pint-sized mason jar and the onions into another (if you mix the two, you’ll muddy the colors).<br/>
2.In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sweetener, salt and optional red pepper flakes (for spicy pickles). Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then pour half of the mixture into each mason jar. Use a spoon to gently press the onions and carrots into the liquid, then let the pickles cool to room temperature. Assuming that you sliced the onions and carrots very thin, they should be ready to eat within thirty minutes or less.<br/>
3.To assemble your sandwiches, spread a hearty layer of hummus onto each slice of toasted bread. Top one slice with a layer of cucumbers, followed by lettuce and some pickles. Place the second slice of bread hummus-side down on top of the pickles. Enjoy!"

It’s a simple weeknight meal that’s hearty, quick and full of healthy greens! Feel free to double the amount of broccoli rabe for extra greens. Recipe yields 2 large or 4 modest servings.
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS<br/>

Soba and broccoli rabe
<br/>
6 ounces soba noodles or whole grain spaghetti<br/>
1 pound broccoli rabe<br/>
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br/>
Salt<br/>
Peanut sauce
<br/><br/>
½ cup creamy peanut butter<br/>
¼ cup reduced sodium tamari or reduced-sodium soy sauce<br/>
3 tablespoons rice vinegar<br/>
3 tablespoons water<br/>
2 tablespoons honey or agave nectar<br/>

Garnishes
<br/>
Small handful chopped fresh cilantro<br/>
1 small lime wedge<br/>
½ teaspoon sesame seeds<br/><br/>

INSTRUCTIONS<br/>

1.Prepare the broccoli rabe by rinsing it well and patting it dry. Slice off the tough lower ends of the stems and discard. Slice off any remaining stems that are over ¼-inch in diameter and discard those as well, since they will be too fibrous even after cooking.<br/>
2.Next, prepare the peanut sauce. In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, whisk together the ingredients until well blended. Set aside.<br/>
3.Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the broccoli rabe and season with a dash of salt and a small pinch of red pepper flakes. Toss to combine and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the leaves have wilted and the stems are easily pierced by a fork, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat.<br/>
4.Once the water is boiling, add the soba noodles and cook just until al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain the noodles, then return them to the pot, add the broccoli rabe and toss with peanut sauce (you might not quite need all of it) until blended.<br/>
5.Transfer to a serving bowl or individual bowls and top with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, a small squeeze of lime juice, a sprinkle of sesame seeds and red pepper flakes, if you’d like some extra heat."
"Tropical Mango Spring Rolls with Avocado-Cilantro Dipping Sauce",./recipes/r18.jpg,"These bold, fresh, mango spring rolls make a perfect spring/summer appetizer. They’re gluten free and vegan for all to enjoy. Spring rolls might seem tricky if you haven’t made them before, but you’ll get the hang of them quickly! Feel free to make these spring rolls a few hours ahead and chill them until you’re ready to serve. Recipe yields 6 to 7 rolls, which I served halved.
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS
<br/>
Spring rolls
<br/>
3 cups lightly packed arugula, roughly chopped<br/>
2 ripe mangos, sliced into long, thin strips (see photos)<br/>
1 large red bell pepper, seeded, membranes removed and sliced into long, thin strips<br/>
2 jalapeños, seeded, membranes removed and sliced into long, thin strips<br/>
4 green onions, green and white parts, chopped (about 1 cup)<br/>
6 to 7 round rice papers, also known as spring roll wrappers or spring roll skins<br/>

2 ripe avocados, diced<br/>
1 cup lime juice (about 2 large limes, juiced)<br/>
1 cup water<br/>
½ cup lightly packed fresh cilantro<br/>
½ teaspoon salt<br/><br/>
INSTRUCTIONS
<br/>
1.Fill a shallow pan larger than your spring roll wrappers (a pie plate works great) with warm water. Fold a lint-free tea towel in half and place it next to the dish. Place your prepared spring roll fillings within reach.<br/>
2.Place one rice paper in the water and let it rest for about twenty seconds. You’ll learn to go by feel here—wait until the sheet is pliable but not super floppy. Carefully lay it flat on the towel.<br/>
3.Leaving about an inch of open rice paper around the edge, cover the lower third of the paper with about ½ cup chopped arugula. Top with four slices of mango down the length of the greens, followed by several slices of bell pepper and jalapeño, and finally, a sprinkle of green onions.<br/>
4.Fold over one long side to enclose the filling, then fold over the short sides like you would a burrito, and lastly, roll it up, stretching the remaining long side around the the roll to seal it. Repeat with remaining ingredients.<br/>
5.To make your avocado sauce, combine the avocado, lime juice, water, cilantro and salt in a small food processor or blender. Purée until smooth and transfer to a small serving bowl. If you won’t be serving the rolls immediately, press plastic wrap against the surface of the dip to prevent oxidation.<br/>
6.Slice the rolls in half on the diagonal with a sharp chef’s knife or serve whole, with avocado dipping sauce on the side."

<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS
<br/>
1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil<br/>
1 ½ teaspoons cumin seeds (scale back a little if you’re not crazy about cumin)<br/>
1 yellow onion, chopped<br/>
1 tablespoon pressed or minced fresh garlic (about 5 cloves)<br/>
1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger (about a 1-inch piece)<br/>
1 green Serrano pepper, minced (seed it first if you want to tame the spice level)<br/>

½ teaspoon ground turmeric<br/>
¾ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt<br/>
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)<br/>
1 can (28 ounces) whole peeled tomatoes, with their juices<br/>
2 cans (14 ounces each) chickpeas (or 3 cups cooked chickpeas), drained and rinsed<br/>
1 cup uncooked brown basmati rice, for serving (rice is optional, I like to cook extra rice to have on hand for other meals)<br/>
Lemon wedges, for garnishing<br/>
Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnishing (optional)<br/><br/>

INSTRUCTIONS
<br/>
1.Cook the rice (if you want to serve the chana masala on rice): Bring a large pot of water to boil on the stove. Pour in the rice and give it a stir. Boil the rice for 30 minutes, then turn off the heat and drain the rice. Return the rice to the pot and cover the pot. Let the rice steam for 10 minutes. Remove the lid, fluff the rice with a fork and season with sea salt to taste.<br/>
2.Cook the chana masala: In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. When a drop of water sizzles upon hitting the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the cumin seeds. Toast the seeds for a minute or two, stirring frequently, until the seeds are golden and fragrant. Watch carefully to avoid burning the seeds.
Raise the heat to medium and stir in the onion, garlic, ginger and serrano. Cook for about five minutes, stirring often. Stir in the garam masala (or tikka masala), coriander, turmeric, salt and cayenne (if using), and cook for two more minutes.<br/>
3.Add the whole peeled tomatoes and their juices. Use the back of a wooden spoon to break the tomatoes apart. You can leave some chunks of tomato for texture.<br/>
4.Raise the heat to medium-high and add the chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes or longer to allow the flavors to develop.
Serve over basmati rice, if desired, and garnish with a lemon wedge or two and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro."

12 ounces (two small containers) small berries, like blueberries and raspberries<br/>
2 teaspoons sugar (preferably turbinado sugar), optional<br/>
Dash of sea salt<br/>
2 tablespoons + ¼ cup honey (to taste)<br/>
2 cups whole Greek yogurt (I used Fage)<br/>
½ small lemon, juiced<br/><br/>

2.While the fruit is roasting, blend together the Greek yogurt and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Mix in honey to taste, until it is barely sweet enough for your liking (keep in mind that the berries will be very sweet). Add more lemon juice if you want tart popsicles.
Let the berries cool for at least ten minutes, then scrape the berries and all of their juices into the bowl of yogurt. Use a big spoon to gently fold the mixture together (for a marbled effect, do not mix thoroughly).<br/>
3.Use the spoon to transfer the yogurt blend into the popsicle mould and insert popsicle sticks. Freeze for at least four hours. When you’re ready to pop out the popsicles, run warm water around the outsides of the moulds for about ten seconds and gently remove the popsicles. Enjoy immediately.<br/>"
"Creamy Chia Pudding",./recipes/r21.jpg,"Creamy chia seed pudding made with cashews, dates and vanilla! This treat is much healthier than traditional pudding. Find a chocolate pudding option, too. Recipe yields 3 to 4 small servings.
<br/><br/>
INGREDIENTS
<br/>
Chia seed pudding
<br/>
1 ½ cups water<br/>
¼ cup chia seeds<br/>
6 large dates<br/>
? cup raw cashews (if you don’t have a high-powered blender, these will likely need to be soaked in water for 2 to 4 hours, then drained)<br/>
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>
½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>
Pinch of sea salt<br/><br/>
Optional toppings
<br/>
Fresh fruit: berries, sliced bananas, chopped pineapple, etc.<br/>
Sprinkle of cocoa powder, mini chocolate chips or finely chopped dark chocolate, toasted coconut, cinnamon, etc.
<br/><br/>
INSTRUCTIONS
<br/>
1.In a liquid measuring cup, combine the water and chia seeds. Set aside until the mixture forms a gel, about 20 minutes.<br/>
2.If your dates aren’t soft and plump, place them in a bowl and pour hot water over them. Set aside for up to 20 minutes, or until the chia seeds are ready. Drain.<br/>
3.Pit the dates. In a blender, combine the pitted dates with the cashews, cinnamon, vanilla and salt. Pour in half or more of the chia gel (I prefer chia seeds in their blended state, so I poured in almost all of mine). Puree until smooth. If your pudding gets warm in the process, you’ll need to chill it until cool.<br/>
4.Serve individual portions of pudding with any remaining chia gel swirled in. Top with any garnishes you’d like. Store leftovers in the refrigerator."
"No Cook Fudge",./recipes/r22.jpg,"The easiest, healthiest fudge you’ll ever make! No thermometer, marshmallow fluff or corn syrup required. It’s vegan and raw, too.

INGREDIENTS
<br/>
½ cup coconut butter*<br/>
1 tablespoon peanut butter**<br/>
2 small ripe bananas, cut into one-inch chunks<br/>
¼ cup raw cacao powder*** or regular cocoa powder<br/>
3 tablespoons agave nectar<br/>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>
¼ teaspoon cinnamon<br/>

INSTRUCTIONS
<br/>
1.Combine all ingredients in a food processor until smooth, roughly five minutes or so.<br/>
2.Use a spatula to pour the mixture into a flat, sealable container.<br/>
3.Place the container in the freezer. The fudge needs to be super cold in order to retain its shape, so I find that it’s best to store the fudge in the freezer. If you store it in the fridge, it will have a semi-solid mousse-like texture."

"Pesto Pasta Salad",./recipes/r25.jpg,"This pesto pasta salad recipe is bursting with fresh flavor. It’s light, healthy and easy to make. Perfect for picnics and potlucks! Recipe yields 6 to 8 side servings.<br/>
<br/>
INGREDIENTS<br/>

1 pound whole grain pasta (fusilli, rotini, penne or farfalle)<br/>
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered<br/>
3 handfuls baby arugula or spinach<br/>
Optional: ½ cup thinly sliced Kalamata olives<br/>
Optional: 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained (or 1 ½ cups cooked chickpeas)<br/>
Optional: Crumbled feta cheese, little mozzarella balls or diced mozzarella or grated Parmesan<br/>
Freshly grated black pepper<br/>
Pesto
<br/>
½ cup pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds)*<br/>
½ cup packed fresh basil leaves<br/>
½ cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves<br/>
¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)<br/>
1 clove garlic, roughly chopped<br/>
½ teaspoon salt<br/>
? cup extra-virgin olive oil<br/><br/>

INSTRUCTIONS
<br/>
1.Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta. Cook the pasta until al dente according to package directions. Before draining, reserve about ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain and immediately rinse the pasta under cool water to prevent the noodles from sticking to one another. Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl.<br/>
2.Meanwhile, to prepare the pesto: In a small skillet, toast the pepitas over medium heat, stirring often, until they are fragrant and making little popping noises, about 5 minutes. Pour half of the pepitas into a bowl for later (we will use them as garnish).<br/>
3.Pour the remaining pepitas into a food processor. Add the basil, parsley, lemon juice, garlic and salt. Process while slowly drizzling in the olive oil, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary, until the pepitas have broken down to create a pretty smooth sauce.
<br/>
4.To assemble the pasta salad, pour all of the pesto over the pasta and toss until the pasta is lightly and evenly coated, adding a tiny splash of reserved pasta cooking water if necessary to thin it out. Then add the cherry tomatoes, arugula, remaining toasted pepitas, and any optional add-ins (olives, chickpeas and/or cheese).<br/>
5.Toss again to combine, then season to taste with pepper. If the pasta needs a little more flavor, add salt or lemon juice to taste, or if the flavors are too bold, let it rest for a few minutes, and add a little splash of olive oil if necessary to tone down the rest."
