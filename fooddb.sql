('Easy Gluten Free Oat Waffles', './recipes/r1.jpg', 'These light, crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-on-the-inside, gluten-free waffles are my favorite waffles! They’re heart healthy, too. This waffle recipe requires just one flour, oat flour, which you can easily make yourself (see note). Recipe yields 3 to 4 round, 7-inch Belgian waffles, or 6 small, square Belgian waffles (the size shown here).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nINGREDIENTS<br/>\r\n\r\n1 ½ cups (128 grams) oat flour*, certified gluten-free if necessary<br/>\r\n2 teaspoons baking powder<br/>\r\n½ teaspoon salt<br/>\r\nPinch of cinnamon, optional<br/>\r\n¾ cup room temperature milk of choice (light coconut milk, nut milk, cow’s milk)<br/>\r\n¼ cup + 1 tablespoon melted coconut oil or 5 tablespoons butter, melted<br/>\r\n2 large eggs<br/>\r\n2 tablespoons maple syrup<br/>\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/><br/>\r\nINSTRUCTIONS<br/>\r\n\r\nIn a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: oat flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. In another bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: milk, melted coconut oil or butter, eggs, maple syrup and vanilla extract. (If your coconut oil solidifies on contact with cold ingredients, gently heat the wet mixture in the microwave in ten seconds intervals, until it melts again.)<br/>\r\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir with a big spoon until just combined (the batter will still be a little lumpy). Let the batter rest for 10 minutes so the oat flour has time to soak up some of the moisture. Plug in your waffle iron to preheat now (if your waffle iron has a temperature/browning dial, set it to medium-high).<br/>\r\nOnce 10 minutes is up, give the batter one more swirl with your spoon. Pour batter onto the heated waffle iron, enough to cover the center and most of the central surface area, and close the lid. Once the waffle is deeply golden and crisp, transfer it to a cooling rack or baking sheet. Don’t stack your waffles on top of each other, or they’ll lose crispness. If desired, keep your waffles warm by placing them in a 200 degree oven until you’re ready to serve.\r\nRepeat with remaining batter. Serve waffles with maple syrup and nut butter, or any other toppings that sound good!'),
('Healthy Pumpkin Muffins', './recipes/r2.jpg', 'Easy, one bowl, maple-sweetened, pumpkin muffins made with whole wheat flour, oats, coconut oil and spices!

If necessary, grease all 12 cups of your muffin tin with butter or non-stick cooking spray (my pan is non-stick and didn’t require any grease).<br/>\r\n2.In a large bowl, beat the oil and maple syrup or honey together with a whisk. Add the eggs, and beat well. Mix in the pumpkin purée and milk, followed by the baking soda, vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice.<br/>\r\n3.Add the flour and oats to the bowl and mix with a large spoon, just until combined. If you’d like to add any additional mix-ins**, like nuts, chocolate or dried fruit, fold them in now.<br/>\r\n4.Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups. For these muffins, it’s ok to fill the cups a little higher than you normally would. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a small amount of oats, followed by a sprinkle of cinnamon. Bake muffins for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.<br/>\r\n5.Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. These muffins are delicate until they cool down (you have been warned!). You might need to run a butter knife along the outer edge of the muffins to loosen them from the pan.\r\nThese muffins will keep at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. They keep well in the freezer in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months (just defrost individual muffins as needed).'),

Drain the peas and return them to the pot.<br/>\r\n3.If you’re planning to fry your egg, sprinkle your cooked peas onto the goat cheese and gently press down on the peas so they stick.<br/>\r\n4.Prepare your egg(s) as desired.

('Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart', './recipes/r9.jpg', 'This chocolate peanut butter tart recipe is creamy and delicious! It’s also vegan, gluten free, and naturally sweetened, believe it or not! While this recipe is pretty easy to make, it requires some cooling/chilling time. Be sure to place cans of regular coconut milk in your refrigerator at least 12 hours in advance (I usually keep a few in my fridge at all times). Recipe yields one 9? tart (about 8 to 10 slices).<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS<br/>\r\n\r\nOat and almond crust<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n2 cups old-fashioned oats (certified gluten-free if necessary)<br/>\r\n½ cup raw almonds<br/>\r\n½ teaspoon salt<br/>\r\nPinch of ground cinnamon<br/>\r\n1 cup melted coconut oil<br/>\r\n3 to 4 tablespoons maple syrup or honey, as needed<br/>\r\nChocolate layer<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n1 ¼ cups bittersweet chocolate chips (about 60% cacao content is perfect)<br/>\r\n1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk, chilled at least 12 hours<br/>\r\n¼ cup maple syrup or honey, to taste<br/>\r\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br/>\r\nDash of salt<br/>\r\nWhipped coconut cream layer<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk, chilled at least 12 hours<br/>\r\n½ cup peanut butter<br/>\r\n2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey<br/>\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\r\nOptional garnishes<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nLight dusting of cocoa powder (sprinkle it over the top in a sifter or fine mesh sieve)<br/>\r\nSprinkles (I used these naturally colored sprinkles)<br/><br/>\r\nINSTRUCTIONS<br/>\r\n\r\n1.To make the crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and lightly oil a 9? tart pan, preferably one with a removable base, with melted coconut oil.\r\nIn the bowl of a food processor fitted with the S blade, combine the oats, almonds, salt, and cinnamon. Process the mixture until the pieces resemble coarse sand. Pour the coconut oil and 3 tablespoons sweetener into the mixture and process until it forms a malleable dough. Add up to 1 tablespoon more sweetener if the dough needs a bit more moisture to come together.<br/>\r\n2.Scoop the dough into your prepared tart pan and fold in any almond or oat crumbs that haven’t already incorporated into the dough. Press the dough into the tart pan evenly, using the heel of your hand to press the bottom smooth, which will help push the crust up the sides. 3.Aim for even thickness across the bottom and up the edges (I didn’t go quite far enough up the edges in my photos). Prick the base of the crust all over with a fork. (If the dough isn’t cooperating, set the crust in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to firm it up before baking.)<br/>\r\n4.Bake the unfilled tart crust for 12 to 14 minutes, until it’s firm to the touch and turning lightly golden at the edges. Place it on a cooling rack until cooled, about 30 minutes.<br/>\r\n5.Meanwhile, to make the chocolate layer: <br/><br/>Gently melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring after every 30 second interval. Let the chocolate cool for 15 to 20 minutes, so that it’s still warm enough to mix with the coconut cream, but not so warm that it melts the cream.<br/>\r\n6.To make the peanut butter whipped cream topping: Open one chilled can of coconut milk. You should see a thick, white layer of condensed coconut cream on top (if not, save the contents of this can for another use and open another can). Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a medium mixing bowl, leaving the more clear coconut “water” behind (you can save the coconut water for smoothies or discard it). Add the peanut butter, sweetener and vanilla extract. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and light, with soft peaks.<br/>\r\n7.To finish the chocolate layer: Once the chocolate has cooled, open another chilled can of coconut milk. Scoop the condensed coconut cream into a clean, medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the semi-cooled chocolate, sweetener, vanilla and salt. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the mixture until it is smooth and somewhat fluffy. Taste and add additional sweetener if desired, keeping in mind that once chilled, it will taste slightly less sweet.<br/>\r\n8.Scoop the chocolate mixture into the baked tart crust. Use a rubber or silicone spatula to evenly distribute the filling and smooth the top. Rinse off and dry your spatula, then use it to spread the whipped cream layer on top, leaving an inch bare around the edges so the chocolate layer remains visible. <br/>Chill the tart for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours or longer, so the coconut whipped cream has time to set.\r\nBefore serving, sprinkle with cocoa powder and/or sprinkle, if desired. If your tart pan has a removable bottom, carefully remove the tart so it’s easier to slice through the edges. Slice the tart into even wedges using a sharp chef’s knife, wiping off the blade after every slice. Serve immediately. This tart keeps well, chilled and covered, for up to 5 days.'),

Recipe yields 9 servings (so quite a bit—if you’re serving just 4 people, I’d probably prepare just 1 pound of strawberries, and enjoy leftover shortcakes as though they are sweet biscuits).<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS\r\n<br/>\r\nShortcake\r\n<br/>\r\n2 ½ cups white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour<br/>\r\n2 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br/>\r\n½ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt<br/>\r\n½ teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>\r\n1 ¼ cups regular (full fat) coconut milk (from a well-shaken can at room temperature*), plus more for brushing on top<br/>\r\n¼ cup honey or maple syrup<br/>\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\r\n1 tablespoon turbinado sugar (optional), for sprinkling on top<br/>\r\nCoconut whipped cream – can be replaced with 2 cups regular whipped cream, if you prefer<br/>\r\n\r\n1 can (14 ounces) regular (full fat) coconut milk or coconut cream, chilled for at least 12 hours<br/>\r\n1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup<br/>\r\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>\r\nStrawberries<br/>\r\n\r\n2 pounds fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced lengthwise, divided (reserve a few small, whole strawberries for garnishing, if you’d like)<br/>\r\n1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n<br/>\r\n1.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside. Place a medium-sized glass or metal mixing bowl in the freezer to chill for the whipped cream.<br/>\r\n2.To prepare the shortcake: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stir to combine.<br/>\r\n3.In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup or smaller mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk, honey and vanilla. Whisk to blend, then pour the wet mixture in to the dry.<br/>\r\n4.Mix with a big spoon until you have a cohesive dough. If the dough is sticky and unmanageable, let it rest for a few minutes—if it’s still being difficult, add another tablespoon of flour and stir just until incorporated.<br/>\r\n5.Lightly flour your work surface, and turn the dough over onto it. Knead the dough a few times, just enough to bring the dough together. Then, press the dough into a square shape about 1 deep.<br/>\r\n6.Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice the dough into 3 even columns and 3 even rows, to make 9 squares. Place the squares onto your prepared baking sheet, leaving a couple inches around each one. Brush the tops of the dough liberally with coconut milk, and sprinkle them with turbinado sugar, if using. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, until they are firm to the touch.<br/>\r\n7.Meanwhile, prepare the coconut whipped cream: Open the can of chilled coconut milk or coconut cream, and scoop the solid white portion into your chilled bowl, leaving the watery part behind. With an electric hand mixer, beat until smooth and relatively fluffy. Add the honey and vanilla extract and blend to combine. Refrigerate until you’re ready to serve.<br/>\r\n8.To prepare the strawberries: Place half of the sliced strawberries in a medium mixing bowl and mash them with a potato masher (or pastry cutter or big fork) until juicy. Add the remaining sliced strawberries and honey and stir to combine. Set aside until ready to serve.<br/>\r\n8.When you’re ready to serve, carefully slice the shortcakes in half lengthwise with a paring knife. Top the lower halve of each shortcake liberally with sliced strawberries, followed by whipped cream. Top with the upper halve of the shortcake. If you want to make them extra decadent, add one more dollop of whipped cream and maybe a small strawberry on top. Serve immediately.'),

Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper and salt, if necessary (the sauce was already plenty salty for me, so I didn’t add any salt).\r\nWhile the sauce cooks, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook your spaghetti according to package directions. Drain and return it to the pot.\r\nIf you’re adding zucchini noodles, spiralize the zucchini with a spiralizer (here’s how), or turn the zucchini into noodles with a julienne peeler, or grate the zucchini the long way on a large box grater.\r\nOnce all of your components are ready, pour the sauce over the pasta and stir to combine. Stir in the zucchini noodles, if using (if you plan on having leftovers, store extra zucchini noodles separately, as they leech water once they come into contact with salty ingredients). Divide into individual bowls and top each bowl with a light sprinkle of parsley. Serve immediately.'),

Taste and stir in additional salt and pepper, if necessary. The pesto will be thick, but we’ll thin it out with cooking water soon.<br/>\r\n5.Pour the pesto into the warm pasta and drizzle in ¼ cup reserved cooking water.

Recipe yields 6 to 8 side servings.<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nINGREDIENTS<br/>\r\n\r\n1 pound whole grain pasta (fusilli, rotini, penne or farfalle)<br/>\r\n1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered<br/>\r\n3 handfuls baby arugula or spinach<br/>\r\nOptional: ½ cup thinly sliced Kalamata olives<br/>\r\nOptional: 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained (or 1 ½ cups cooked chickpeas)<br/>\r\nOptional: Crumbled feta cheese, little mozzarella balls or diced mozzarella or grated Parmesan<br/>\r\nFreshly grated black pepper<br/>\r\nPesto\r\n<br/>\r\n½ cup pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds)*<br/>\r\n½ cup packed fresh basil leaves<br/>\r\n½ cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves<br/>\r\n¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)<br/>\r\n1 clove garlic, roughly chopped<br/>\r\n½ teaspoon salt<br/>\r\n? cup extra-virgin olive oil<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n<br/>\r\n1.Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta. Cook the pasta until al dente according to package directions. Before draining, reserve about ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain and immediately rinse the pasta under cool water to prevent the noodles from sticking to one another. Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl.<br/>\r\n2.Meanwhile, to prepare the pesto: In a small skillet, toast the pepitas over medium heat, stirring often, until they are fragrant and making little popping noises, about 5 minutes. Pour half of the pepitas into a bowl for later (we will use them as garnish).<br/>\r\n3.Pour the remaining pepitas into a food processor. Add the basil, parsley, lemon juice, garlic and salt. Process while slowly drizzling in the olive oil, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary, until the pepitas have broken down to create a pretty smooth sauce.\r\n<br/>\r\n4.To assemble the pasta salad, pour all of the pesto over the pasta and toss until the pasta is lightly and evenly coated, adding a tiny splash of reserved pasta cooking water if necessary to thin it out. Then add the cherry tomatoes, arugula, remaining toasted pepitas, and any optional add-ins (olives, chickpeas and/or cheese).<br/>\r\n5.Toss again to combine, then season to taste with pepper. If the pasta needs a little more flavor, add salt or lemon juice to taste, or if the flavors are too bold, let it rest for a few minutes, and add a little splash of olive oil if necessary to tone down the rest.');
